# Days Since ðŸ“…

A modern web application for tracking days since specific events, organized by teams/groups. Built with React frontend and Node.js backend, deployed as a single Docker container.

## Features

- **Event Tracking**: Track important events with timestamps
- **Days Since Calculation**: Automatic calculation of days since last occurrence
- **Frequency Analysis**: Show patterns and average days between events
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with friendly interface
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses existing TheClusterFlux MongoDB infrastructure
